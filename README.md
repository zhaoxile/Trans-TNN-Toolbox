## 1. Introduction

The transformed tensor nuclear norm captures the low-rankness of the frontal slices under the given transform, which mitigates the inherent information loss
to matricization or tensor flattening. We develop a transformed tensor nuclear norm (TransTNN) toolbox in Matlab with the tensor completion task as an
example. The TransTNN toolbox includes the classical transformed tensor nuclear norm methods [1], such as the standrad DFT-based TNN, the unitary transformed TNN (UTNN), the framelet transformed TNN (FTNN), and the nonlinear transformed TNN (NTTNN). Table 1 lists the used functions in the TransTNN toolbox.

## 2. Example

Simply run the “Demo.m” to test all the transformed tensor nuclear norm methods.

## 1. Introduction

The transformed tensor singular values decomposition (t-SVD) captures the low-rankness of the frontal slices under the given transform, which mitigates the inherent information loss to matricization or tensor flattening. We develop a TranTSVD toolbox in Matlab with the tensor completion task as an example. The TranTSVD toolbox includes the classical transformed t-SVD methods [1], such as the standrad DFT-based TNN [2,3,4], the unitary transformed TNN (UTNN) [5], the framelet transformed TNN (FTNN) [6], and the nonlinear transformed TNN (NTTNN) [7].

## 2. Example

Simply run the “Demo.m” to test all the transformed tensor nuclear norm methods.
